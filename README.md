# Netflix-recomendation-engine
Netflix is all about connecting people to the movies they love. To help customers find those movies, they developed world-class movie recommendation system: CinematchSM. Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. Netflix use those predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customerâ€™s unique tastes. And while Cinematch is doing pretty well, it can always be made better.
